# Project Brief

## Project Overview

**ClipGo** is a Chrome extension that solves the problem of losing valuable insights from AI conversations by providing users with an intuitive way to save, organize, and retrieve clips from platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI services.

## Problem Statement

AI conversations contain valuable insights, ideas, and information that users frequently lose in chat histories. Users struggle with:
- **Information Overload**: Long AI conversations make it difficult to find important snippets later
- **Poor Organization**: Limited options for categorizing and structuring saved content
- **Platform Fragmentation**: Different AI platforms have inconsistent save and search features
- **Context Loss**: Saved content often loses important context like source and metadata

## Solution

ClipGo provides a unified solution with:
- **Universal Capture**: Works across multiple AI conversation platforms
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Notion-style category system for structured knowledge management
- **Rich Metadata**: Automatic capture of source, timestamp, and context
- **Instant Access**: Quick save workflow with minimal disruption to conversation flow

## Project Scope

### MVP Features (Current Focus)
- **Text Selection & Save**: Select text in AI conversations and save instantly
- **Hierarchical Categories**: Create nested category structures for organization
- **Overlay Popup**: In-page save interface with pre-filled metadata
- **Basic Management**: View, copy, and delete saved clips
- **Internationalization**: Korean and English language support
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Automatic theme detection and support

### Technical Implementation
- **Chrome Extension**: Manifest V3 architecture
- **Local Storage**: Chrome Storage API for data persistence
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies for minimal footprint
- **Content Scripts**: Direct interaction with web pages
- **Service Worker**: Background processing and system integration

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- **Save Success Rate**: ≥95% of save operations complete successfully
- **Performance**: Save operations complete in <200ms
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Chrome 90+ and Edge 90+
- **Data Integrity**: No data loss during normal operations

### User Experience Goals
- **Ease of Use**: New users can successfully save content within 5 minutes
- **Intuitive Interface**: Minimal learning curve for core features
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear confirmation of successful operations
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Business Objectives
- **User Adoption**: 35% of users perform ≥2 saves in first 24 hours
- **Feature Utilization**: 50% of users use drag & drop categorization
- **Retention**: Weekly active users maintain consistent usage patterns
- **Quality**: User satisfaction rating ≥4.0/5.0

## Key Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Individuals using AI conversation platforms for work and learning
- **Development Team**: Engineers implementing and maintaining the extension
- **Product Management**: Team defining requirements and roadmap

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **AI Platform Users**: Communities around ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
- **Knowledge Management Professionals**: People interested in personal KM tools
- **Chrome Extension Reviewers**: Google team reviewing extension for store approval

## Technical Constraints

### Platform Limitations
- **Manifest V3**: Service worker restrictions and background processing limits
- **Storage Limits**: Chrome local storage limit of ~10MB
- **Browser Compatibility**: Chrome and Edge only (no Firefox/Safari support)
- **Security Requirements**: Chrome Web Store security and privacy policies

### Development Constraints
- **Timeline**: MVP implementation within estimated 11-day development period
- **Resources**: Single developer with part-time availability
- **Technology Stack**: Vanilla JavaScript with minimal external dependencies
- **Testing**: Manual testing through browser DevTools

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Manifest V3 Compatibility**: Service worker limitations affecting functionality
- **Storage Limitations**: Data growth exceeding local storage capacity
- **Cross-Site Issues**: Content script injection problems on different platforms
- **Performance Issues**: UI slowdown with large datasets

### User Experience Risks
- **Complexity**: Feature creep making the interface confusing
- **Performance**: Slow operations frustrating users
- **Compatibility**: Issues with specific AI platform updates
- **Privacy**: User concerns about data collection and storage

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Development**: Start with core features, add complexity gradually
- **Performance Monitoring**: Regular testing with realistic datasets
- **User Feedback**: Early and frequent user testing
- **Privacy-First Design**: Transparent data handling and local storage

## Timeline & Milestones

### Current Phase: MVP Implementation
- **Week 1-2**: Core architecture and storage system
- **Week 2-3**: Category management and UI components
- **Week 3-4**: Popup integration and event handling
- **Week 4-5**: Testing, optimization, and deployment

### Future Phases
- **Phase 2**: Advanced search and filtering
- **Phase 3**: Export capabilities and platform integrations
- **Phase 4**: Collaboration features and cloud sync

## Measuring Success

### Quantitative Metrics
